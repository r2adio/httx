* Transmission Control Protocol
  - reliable and in-order packets
  - use-case: http/https(web browsing), smtp(email), ftp(file transfer)
  - establishes a connection b/w client and server, before data transfer begins

* Internals of TCP
  - Three-way Handshake:
  --- *SYN* : client sends a "Synchronize" packet to server, to initiate connection
  --- *SYN-ACK* : server responds w/ "Synchronize-Acknowledgment" packet
  --- *ACK* : client sends "Acknowledgment" to confirm connection

  - Data Transfer:
  --- data is broken into smaller packets, each w/ a sequence num to ensure correct order
  --- tcp guarantees delivery by retransmitting lost or corrupted packets
  --- use mechanisms like, *flow control* (prevent overwhelming receiver) and *congestion control* (avoid network overload)
  - Connection Termination:
  --- connection is closed using a *four-way Handshake* (FIN & ACK from both sides)

* Features of TCP
  - *Reliability* : no data is lost, using acknowledgments and retransmissions
  - *Ordered Delivery* : assembles and reassembles packets in correct order
  - *Flow Control* : use *sliding window* mechanism to manage data flow
  - *Congestion Control* : adjusts transmission rate to avoid network congestion
  - *Connection-Oriented* : requires connectin to be established before data transfer
  - *Error Checking* : uses checksums to detect errors
